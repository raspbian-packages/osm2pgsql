osm2pgsql (0.70.5+r25090-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New SVN snapshot
  * debian/control:
    - fix Vcs-* fields to point to the git repository.
    - added pkg-osm to Uploaders
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.1, no changes needed
  * Use "3.0 (quilt)" format
  * Removed useless dpatch machinery
  * Use dh7 for debian/rules
  * Improve get-orig-source target
  * Wrapped multi-value fields in debian/control
  * Bump debhelper compatibility to 8
  * debian/docs updated
  * Use new DebianGIS e-mail address
  * Add Build-Dependencies on zlib, protobuf-c and dh-autoreconf
  * Use DEP-5 for debian/copyright
  * Clean protoc-generated files during the clean target
  * Updated manpage
  * Fix FTBFS, due to missing linkage with zlib (00-fix_build.patch)
  * Remove 'gazetteer' from the packaged examples. It has become quite huge
    (90M unpacked), and I suppose not much people need it. It might become
    a separate binary package in future, though.
    Also remove it from the "orig" tarball. I'll reintroduce it as soon
    as someone actually asks for it.
  * Don't actually build gazetteer (01-disable_gazetteer.patch)
