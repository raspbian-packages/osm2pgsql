== osm2pgsql ==

* there is still room for code cleanups

** the postgres specific files also contain some general functions
  that could/should be moved out to separate files so that they
  may be shared by other middle and output backends in the future

* in the long run it may make sense to go for C++ all the way

** the C++ interface to Google ProtoBuffers is much more mature than
   its C counterpart

** inheriting input, middle, and output plugin implementations from
   abstract C++ base clases would provide a cleaner and more readable
   interface than the current C99 struct based implementation IMHO

== gazeteer ==

* have relative .libs path to gazetteer.so in the gazeteer-functions.sql
  file, replace the relative path with the absolute install path on
  "make install" instead of having it replaced when generating the .sql
  file from a .sql.in template on "make" time 

* install all the .php / website helper files on "make install"

* document changes on http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim/Installation
  and regenerate gazeteer/README.txt from it

* install gazeteer/README.txt on "make install" ?
