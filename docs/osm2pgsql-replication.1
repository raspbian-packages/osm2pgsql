.SH NAME
osm2pgsql-replication \- osm2pgsql database updater
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B osm2pgsql-replication
[-h] {init,update,status} ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Update an osm2pgsql database with changes from a OSM replication server.
.br

.br
This tool initialises the updating process by looking at the import file
.br
or the newest object in the database. The state is then saved in a table
.br
in the database. Subsequent runs download newly available data and apply
.br
it to the database.
.br

.br
See the help of the \(cqinit\(cq and \(cqupdate\(cq command for more information on
.br
how to use osm2pgsql\-replication.

.SH OPTIONS 'osm2pgsql-replication init'
usage: osm2pgsql-replication init [-h] [-q] [-v] [-d DB] [-U NAME] [-H HOST]
                                  [-P PORT] [-p PREFIX]
                                  [--middle-schema SCHEMA] [--schema SCHEMA]
                                  [--osm-file FILE | --server URL]
                                  [--start-at TIME]

Initialise the replication process.
.br

.br
This function sets the replication service to use and determines from
.br
which date to apply updates. You must call this function at least once
.br
to set up the replication process. It can safely be called again later
.br
to change the replication servers or to roll back the update process and
.br
reapply updates.
.br

.br
There are different methods available for initialisation. When no
.br
additional parameters are given, the data is initialised from the data
.br
in the database. If the data was imported from a file with replication
.br
information and the properties table is available (for osm2pgsql >= 1.9)
.br
then the replication from the file is used. Otherwise the minutely
.br
update service from openstreetmap.org is used as the default replication
.br
service. The start date is either taken from the database timestamp
.br
(for osm2pgsql >= 1.9) or determined from the newest way in the database
.br
by querying the OSM API about its creation date.
.br

.br
The replication service can be changed with the \(cq\-\-server\(cq parameter.
.br
To use a different start date, add \(cq\-\-start\-at\(cq with an absolute
.br
ISO timestamp (e.g. 2007\-08\-20T12:21:53Z). When the program determines the
.br
start date from the database timestamp or way creation date, then it
.br
subtracts another 3 hours by default to ensure that all new changes are
.br
available. To change this rollback period, use \(cq\-\-start\-at\(cq with the
.br
number of minutes to rollback. This rollback mode can also be used to
.br
force initialisation to use the database date and ignore the date
.br
from the replication information in the file.
.br

.br
The initialisation process can also use replication information from
.br
an OSM file directly and ignore all other date information.
.br
Use the command \(cqosm2pgsql-replication \-\-osm\-file <filename>\(cq for this.



.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Print only error messages

.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Increase verboseness of output

.TP
\fB\-d\fR DB, \fB\-\-database\fR DB
Name of PostgreSQL database to connect to or conninfo string

.TP
\fB\-U\fR NAME, \fB\-\-username\fR NAME
PostgreSQL user name

.TP
\fB\-H\fR HOST, \fB\-\-host\fR HOST
Database server host name or socket location

.TP
\fB\-P\fR PORT, \fB\-\-port\fR PORT
Database server port

.TP
\fB\-p\fR PREFIX, \fB\-\-prefix\fR PREFIX
Prefix for table names (default 'planet_osm')

.TP
\fB\-\-middle\-schema\fR SCHEMA
Name of the schema to store the table for the replication state in

.TP
\fB\-\-schema\fR SCHEMA
Name of the schema for the database

.TP
\fB\-\-osm\-file\fR FILE
Get replication information from the given file.

.TP
\fB\-\-server\fR URL
Use replication server at the given URL

.TP
\fB\-\-start\-at\fR TIME
Time when to start replication. When an absolute timestamp (in ISO format) is given, it will be used. If a number is given, then replication starts the number of minutes before the known date of the database.

.SH OPTIONS 'osm2pgsql-replication update'
usage: osm2pgsql-replication update update [options] [-- param [param ...]]

Download newly available data and apply it to the database.
.br

.br
The data is downloaded in chunks of \(cq\-\-max\-diff\-size\(cq MB. Each chunk is
.br
saved in a temporary file and imported with osm2pgsql from there. The
.br
temporary file is normally deleted afterwards unless you state an explicit
.br
location with \(cq\-\-diff\-file\(cq. Once the database is up to date with the
.br
replication source, the update process exits with 0.
.br

.br
Any additional arguments to osm2pgsql need to be given after \(cq\-\-\(cq. Database
.br
and the prefix parameter are handed through to osm2pgsql. They do not need
.br
to be repeated. \(cq\-\-append\(cq and \(cq\-\-slim\(cq will always be added as well.
.br

.br
Use the \(cq\-\-post\-processing\(cq parameter to execute a script after osm2pgsql has
.br
run successfully. If the updates consists of multiple runs because the
.br
maximum size of downloaded data was reached, then the script is executed
.br
each time that osm2pgsql has run. When the post\-processing fails, then
.br
the entire update run is considered a failure and the replication information
.br
is not updated. That means that when 'update' is run the next time it will
.br
recommence with downloading the diffs again and reapplying them to the
.br
database. This is usually safe. The script receives two parameters:
.br
the sequence ID and timestamp of the last successful run. The timestamp
.br
may be missing in the rare case that the replication service stops responding
.br
after the updates have been downloaded.

.TP
\fBparam\fR
Extra parameters to hand in to osm2pgsql.

.TP
\fB\-\-diff\-file\fR FILE
File to save changes before they are applied to osm2pgsql.

.TP

Sample output:
.br

.br
    2021\-08\-17 15:20:28 [INFO]: Using replication service 'https://planet.openstreetmap.org/replication/minute', which is at sequence 4675115 ( 2021\-08\-17T13:19:43Z )
